        <h1>Human Effect on Species and Habitat Conservation</h1>
        <center><h3>by Cameron Santiago for MMP 100-0901.</h3></center>

        <div class="left"><p>The importance of biodiversity, at all scales, poses a significant threat against the world as we know it today. With human impact increasing despite continuous loss, mass extinction becomes exceedingly prominent in terms of loss in genetic diversity and ecosystems. With this dramatic change, the major cause for concern rearranges the composition of land and wildlifeâ€“ often increasing the amount of pollution as acid rain, pesticide and chemical balances overtake bodies of water. In some species, less than 100 remain, all of which are usually under close protection by countries who are striving to prevent further loss.</p></div>
